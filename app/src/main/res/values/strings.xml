    <string name="para1_before_page">The first thing to remember is that homeless people are a diverse group of people just like everyone else, no matter how they look, no matter their gender, age, or race. Some have fallen on hard times. Some may be struggling with mental illness. But everyone wants to be treated with respect and dignity. Here are some steps to follow before you go:</string>

    <string name="healthy_snacks_details">Nonperishable and nutritious snacks such as nuts, pretzels, breakfast bars, applesauce, and dried fruit are best. Try to include items that are easy to chew for individuals without access to dental care. Remember to pack food items separately from any scented sanitary products.</string>
    <string name="water_details">Finding potable water can be difficult for homeless individuals. Bottled water is a great donation item, as is carrying a jug and cups.</string>
    <string name="first_aid_details">Infection prevention and first aid care are essential, especially for homeless people. Give sealed, clean items like bandages, wipes, ointments, and nail care kits to protect those in need. Avoid alcohol-based products.</string>
    <string name="personal_hygiene_details">Soaps should be fragrance-free, since sensitivities and allergies are common. Make sure hand sanitizers do not contain alcohol. Toothpaste and toothbrushes make practical and useful donation items.</string>
    <string name="sock_clothing_details">Clothing items are essential through all seasons, notably warm clothes. Socks are especially crucial. They are affordable, easy to find, and overall great items to include.</string>
    <string name="feminine_hygiene_details">Tampons and pads are necessities, and yet something that many families experiencing homelessness struggle to obtain every month. Consider different needs such as heavy, moderate, and light flow.</string>
